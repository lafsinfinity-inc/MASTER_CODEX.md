LAFSINFINITY INC. operates as the root intellectual property and architectural authority for all subordinate divisions, platforms, and initiatives described herein.

Each entity retains separate legal identity, accounts, and compliance obligations.

3. DOEGONANAS — DEFINITION & PURPOSE

DOEGONANAS is a digital attribution and utility framework, not a bank, insurer, broker, or tax authority.

It is designed to:

Track voluntary contributions, grants, licenses, and value attributions

Issue non-equity digital tokens representing participation, access, or acknowledgment

Support charitable, educational, and community-based initiatives

Enable transparent record-keeping via public blockchain metadata

DOEGONANAS does not:

Guarantee profits

Replace regulated financial products

Provide tax advice

Issue securities unless separately registered and approved

4. DIGITAL TOKEN CLASSIFICATION (HIGH-LEVEL)

All DOEGONANAS-related digital instruments are classified as Utility / Attribution Tokens, unless explicitly reclassified through lawful registration.

Possible utilities include:

Access permissions

Educational participation

Community recognition

Platform interaction credits

Symbolic value attribution

No token represents:

Equity

Debt

Insurance

Guaranteed return

Ownership of real property

5. METADATA REQUIREMENTS (CORE)

Every DOEGONANAS-issued digital asset MUST include:

{
  "issuer": "LAFSINFINITY INC.",
  "framework": "DOEGONANAS",
  "asset_type": "Utility / Attribution Token",

}

6. CHARITABLE INTERFACE (W.A.H.P.)

When DOEGONANAS interfaces with WE ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE INC.:

Contributions are voluntary donations

Appraisals, acknowledgments, or receipts are issued solely by the nonprofit

LAFSINFINITY INC. does not certify tax deductibility

Donors are responsible for consulting licensed professionals

This preserves legal separation and compliance.

7. PROPERTY & ASSET MANAGEMENT ROLE (K.A.D. HOLDINGZ)

K.A.D. Holdingz may act as:

Manager

Steward

Administrator

It does not automatically assume ownership.

Any real property interaction requires:

Independent contracts

Independent appraisal

Independent legal review

Compliance with local, state, and federal law

No automated transfer of ownership is implied by digital participation.

8. INTERNAL ECONOMIC SIMULATION / IPO-EQUIVALENT CONCEPT

LAFSINFINITY INC. may design internal economic simulations, educational markets, or closed-loop participation systems.

These systems:

Are not public securities

Are not tradable on public exchanges

Are used for education, modeling, and internal incentive alignment

Any future IPO or public offering requires:

Separate entity

Separate filings

Regulatory approval

9. AIRDROP & ASSISTANCE MECHANISM (NON-PREDATORY)

Onboard users

Provide learning tools

Encourage participation

Support under-resourced individuals

Airdrops:

Are revocable under abuse prevention rules

10. VISUAL & IDENTITY CONTROL

All logos, signatures, likenesses, and visual representations are:

Copyright © LAFSINFINITY INC.

Protected against unauthorized commercial exploitation

Claymation, avatar, or stylized representations are artistic interpretations, not biometric identity claims.

11. GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES

Transparency over opacity

Separation over commingling

Assistance without dependency

Lawful innovation over shortcuts

12. DISCLAIMERS (MANDATORY)
